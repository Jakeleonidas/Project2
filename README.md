Overview
For this project, you will be creating a movie browsing app similar to Flixster. This is a two-part project. For this initial portion, you will use hardcoded Movie data models to display mocked data. You will add networking capability in the second part.

For the lab portion, we found our hardcoded information by using the Tunely API and copying the information over. For the assignment, we will use The Movie Database API. We can use this endpoint to get some hardcoded data, but feel free to look up your own.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
By the end of this assignment you will be able to...

Use table views and custom table view cells to display a list of arbitrary data to the user
Required Features
Users can see a customized app icon and launch screen
Movie List - Displays at least 5 different movies in a table view
Users can view the title, poster image, partial description of each movie
Users can tap into a cell to view more information about the movie

You must use remote (non-local) images in your hardcoded data models. Preferrably, although not required, also use Nuke installed via Swift Package Manager (as done in the lab) to handle fetching of images.
 Movie Details
Users can view the title, full description, backdrop image, vote average, vote count, popularity
